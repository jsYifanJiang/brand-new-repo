# Yifan Introduction

My name is Yifan Jiang. I'm a master student of MSc Data Science for Cultural Heritage.
I come from China. I was born in Nantong City, Jiangsu Province and live in Shanghai.
I got my BEng degree in Civil Engineering from the University of Edinburgh. To be frank,
the weather in london is much better to that in Edinburgh. However, we don't have to go to
school during snowstorm.
